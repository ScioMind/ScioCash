## SCIO/ScioCash                           

SCIO/ScioCash is a project of the Scionics Institute, undertaken for the Chuch of Scio-Buddhism. It is a fork of the privacy-centric Cryptonote, and is intended to be used as the sacred sovereign money of the Church of Scio-Buddhism, and of all people, anywhere, of any faith or philosophy, who choose to exercise their individual sacred sovereign rights.

We believe that privacy and freedom of expression, including financial privacy and freedom of expression, is the supremely sacred sovereign, spiritual, and religious right of all individuals.

It is written, "Give unto Ceasar that which is Ceasar's." ScioCash is NOT Ceasar's -- it is yours, and using it is your right.

The names "SCIO" and "ScioCash" are religious terms which are also Copyright and Trademark, 2017, Scionics Institute and the Church of Scio-Buddhism.

ScioCash is a fork of the privacy-centric Cryptonote.
